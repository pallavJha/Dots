## Dots
### .files and config files for i3, vim and whatnot!

This repository contains the dot files for various plugins or systems that I use. The directory name is the name of the machine on which the dot file is deployed.

1. [Sony Vaio i3](/sony-vaio)
2. [Thinkpad e14 2nd Gen i3](/thinkpad-e14-2nd-gen)
3. [✨ For all things Vim ✨](/vim)
